# Salutations,

## Description
Minor Project for extracting the item list and prices for a given restaurant operating in Swiggy.com by specifying a given url. <br>
Web Scraping minor project, not meant for commercialisation. It is simply a means to an end and a way for me to help my dad. <br>

## Usage
Clone the repo and run main.py

### Warning Before Use
Web Scraping is an aspect of coding that is not very refined and relies more on semantics from the web developer, as a result of this if the design of the web page changes many web scraping projects break. Extracting data is mostly done by contacting Web-Based APIs specific to the web application nowadays which, in my opinion, is a better process. Unfortunately I could neither find a proper way to access the API nor a module made by somebody else (I found a few but they were not as great) since I am still a newbie programmer (As of 01/12/2021 DD/MM/YYYY) This code is something I wrote because my dad gave me a task that would be really taxing to do manually and I wanted to automate it. If I find a better way to do this than Web Scraping I would do my best to update it.
